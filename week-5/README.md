Use vite for creating the react project.

Use [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) or [behance](https://www.behance.net/) for design and styling inspiration.

This is a solo project. Each student needs to work on the project separately.

The assignment is to be done in levels. Your score for this assignment will be provided on the basis of levels you complete. You have to complete at least 4 levels. But you can complete more if you want to increase your score.
